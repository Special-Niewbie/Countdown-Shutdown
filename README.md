> If your browser or antivirus flags **Countdown & Shutdown** as "unsafe," **do not worry** — this is a **false positive**.

> Unfortunately, this often results in safe, small independent projects being incorrectly flagged.  



- **Countdown & Shutdown** is a lightweight and handy tool designed to automatically shut down your computer after a set period of time — up to 48 hours. It’s especially useful when you're at home or in the office and need to leave your computer running to finish tasks like downloading large files, rendering, or processing data that can't be interrupted.

  Instead of waiting for your system to finish, you can simply schedule an automatic shutdown and leave with peace of mind, knowing your computer will power off safely based on your selected timer settings.
